üñºÔ∏è Image Caption Generator using CNN + LSTM
This project implements an end-to-end Image Captioning system that generates descriptive captions for images using a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.

üìå Project Overview
Image captioning is the process of generating textual descriptions for images. This project extracts visual features from images using a pre-trained CNN (Xception) and feeds them into an LSTM-based sequence model to generate coherent, grammatically correct captions.

üß† Architecture
The architecture follows the encoder-decoder pattern:

Encoder: A pre-trained CNN (Xception) is used to extract a fixed-length feature vector (2048-dimensional) from each image. These features represent the high-level content of the image.

Decoder: The decoder is an LSTM-based neural network that:

Takes the encoded image vector and a partial sequence of words as input.

Learns to predict the next word in the caption.

Repeats the process to generate a complete sentence.

Tokenizer: Used to convert words to integer sequences and define the vocabulary used for training.

Loss Function: Categorical or sparse categorical crossentropy depending on the shape of the target output.

üßæ Key Components
Image Preprocessing:

Resizes images to the shape required by Xception.

Extracts and stores feature vectors using the pre-trained Xception model with include_top=False and pooling='avg'.

Text Preprocessing:

Cleans and normalizes the caption data.

Adds start and end tokens to guide the LSTM.

Sequence Generation:

Creates input-output sequences for each caption, where input is the image + partial caption and output is the next word.

Model Training:

Trains a model that learns to map image features and partial captions to the next word.

Multiple checkpoints can be saved during training to evaluate performance over epochs.

üìÇ Output
The trained model generates captions for new images using the Xception features as input.

üí° Highlights
Used Transfer Learning to leverage Xception without training a CNN from scratch.

Handled variable-length captions using padding and masking.

Used teacher forcing for faster convergence during training.

Modular design makes it easy to swap out components (e.g., use ResNet instead of Xception, or GRU instead of LSTM).

üìå Applications
Descriptive tagging for image search engines

Accessibility tools for visually impaired users

Automatic photo album captioning

Real-time captioning for surveillance or robotic vision
